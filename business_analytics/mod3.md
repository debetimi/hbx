### 3.1.1 - Amazon's Use of Hypothesis Testing

Methods for Collecting Samples 
 1. Survey - Ask questions and record self reported responses from random sample of populatiojn.jlko
 2. Observational Study - Observe and Collect Data about sample as they occur naturally without intervention
 3. Experiment - Divid sample into two groupts.  In one group, "treatment" group, manipulate a variable and compare responses to control group.

 
Amazon uses _A/B Testing_ which is commonly used in software testing. Amazon will change the way the site looks or add new features, and send a random sample of visitors to this modified page and then collect metrics and analyze the data.


## 3.2 - Designing and Performing Hypothesis Tests

### 3.2.1 Developing Hypotheses

**Null Hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>)** - Statement about a topic of interest based on historical information or conventional wisdom.  We start a hypothesis test by assuming the null hypothesis is true an then test to see if we can nullify it.

**Alternate Hypthesis (H<sub>a</sub>) - Opposite of the Null Hypothesis thisi s the claim we are trying to substantiate. If our data allows us to nullify the null hypothesis, we substantiate the alternative hypothesis.

Hypothesis Test has two possible outcomes.  We either reject the null hypothesis, or we fail to reject it because we have inconclusive evidence.

 + Example Criminal Law: H<sub>0</sub> = Accused is Innocent. H<sub>a</sub> the accused is guilty.  The possible outcomes from the trial are guilty or not guilty.  Meaning we can reject the null hypothesis with guilty, or re can fail to reject it with not guilty.  But we cannot confirm it, meaning we can't say the defendant is innocent.
