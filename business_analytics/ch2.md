# 2 Sampling and Estimation

## 2.1 Introduction
Often we wish to analyze a large set of people

- Population: The set
- Members: The people or objects in set.

Due to time or resources we often can't analyze all the members of the population so we analyze a *sample*. A subset that is representative of the entire set

### 2.1.1 Sampling at Amazon
From the Amazon case we can see that sample is a lower cost way to glean information about statistics of interest. It is expensive in cost and time to gather information for every single point of data.

### 2.2.1 Samples vs. Populations
Before we take a sample we need clear understanding of problem we need to address based on that understandng we do things:

1. Select correct target population to sample.
2. Determine the question we want to ask about that sample

**Key Point**: To obtain a representative sample we need to choose the people at random otherwise there will be sample bias.

Sample Cycle:

1. Select correct target population
2. Sample the population
3. Analyze the results
4. Draw Conclusions about the population

The numerical properties of populations are called parameters and those of a sample are called statistics.  A statistic is an estimate of a true value of a paramters.  The larger the sample the more accurately statistics predict parameters.
