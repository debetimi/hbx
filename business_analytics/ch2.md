# 2 Sampling and Estimation

## 2.1 Introduction
Often we wish to analyze a large set of people

- Population: The set
- Members: The people or objects in set.

Due to time or resources we often can't analyze all the members of the population so we analyze a *sample*. A subset that is representative of the entire set

## 2.2 Sampling

### 2.1.1 Sampling at Amazon
From the Amazon case we can see that sample is a lower cost way to glean information about statistics of interest. It is expensive in cost and time to gather information for every single point of data.

### 2.2.1 Samples vs. Populations
Before we take a sample we need clear understanding of problem we need to address based on that understandng we do things:

1. Select correct target population to sample.
2. Determine the question we want to ask about that sample

**Key Point**: To obtain a representative sample we need to choose the people at random otherwise there will be sample bias.

Sample Cycle:

1. Select correct target population
2. Sample the population
3. Analyze the results
4. Draw Conclusions about the population

The numerical properties of populations are called parameters and those of a sample are called statistics.  A statistic is an estimate of a true value of a paramters.  The larger the sample the more accurately statistics predict parameters.

|     | Mean | Standard Deviation |
| --- |:----:|:------------------:|
| Population (parameters) | &mu; | &sigma;|
| Sample (statistics)     | x&#772; | s |

#### Amazon
Uses software to randomly send employees to various shelves/type of shelves to check accuracy of inventory tracking system. The use statistics to figure out the smallest sample at the right frequency to figure out statistical significance of results.

### 2.2.2 Sample Size
In addition to deciding how to sample, we must also decide how large the sample should be.

Key Note: Sample size is _not_ indicative of sample quality meaning we don't have to sample a larger population in greater numbers than smaller population to get an accurate sample. Think about sampling the number of female employees at a company.  If the sample size is significant say 1000. It doesn't matter if the company is 20,000 or 200,000 because 1,000 is statistically significant.

A large sample size is useful if you are trying to detect something rare.

As you increase sample size, sample mean and std move closer to population mean and stdev.

### 2.2.3 Avoiding Bias
Avoid using leading languages or phrases.

 + Good: Is underage drinking acceptable?
 + Bad: Underage drinking is okay, right? This leads the respondent into agreeing with question.

Cononical Example: Politically charged words 

+ Does the government spend enough money on assistance to the poor. 64% Said too little
+ Does the goverment spend enough money on welfare. 19% said too little.

Response Rates

+ Low response rates often lead to bias if the non-responders represent a differnt segment of the population than the respondees.  If we have a low resrate we should contact non-respondents in order to increase the response rate or demostrate non-respondents do not respresent a different segment of the population

### 2.2 Summary
+ Make sure the sample is representative of the population by choosing members randomly to ensure that each member of the population is equally likely to be included in the sample.
+ Choose the right sample size:
 + Sample size does not necessarily depend on population size. The right sample size depends on desired accuracy and in some cases, the likelihood of the phenomenon we wish to observe or measure.

+ Avoid biased results by
 + Phrasing questions neutrally
 + Ensuring that the sampling method is appropriate for the demographic of the target population
 + Pursuing high response rates. It is often better to have a smaller sample with a high response rate than a larger sample with a low response rate.
