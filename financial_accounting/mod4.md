# Module 4 - Adjusting Journal Entries

## 4.1 Introduction
### 4.1.1 Explicit vs. Implicit Transactions

**Explicit Transactions** - Transactions that involve some activity, event, or exchange of resources from one party to another. Explicit transactions are often accompanied by invoices or other paper documentation that initiates the recording of the transaction

**Implicit Transactions** - Transactions that do not involve a specific triggering activity, event, or exchange of resources from one party to another, and that are not accompanied by an invoice or other paper documentation. Often, implicit transactions represent changes in value related to the passage of time, such as depreciation, interest expense, and the amortization of a prepaid expense. Implicit transactions are often recorded using adjusting journal entries.
 + Examples: recognizing deferred revenue through passage of time. recognizing expense as equipment is used. recognizing depreciation.

## 4.2 Accruals and Deferrals
### 4.2.1 Accruals

If you dont have an invoice yet and you are recording an acrrued expense, make sure to credit accrued expenses and not accounts payable.

Another way to look at accruals is to think of them as transactions where cash changes hands after revenue or expense is recognized, and you can think of them as either accruals related to revenue or accruals related to expenses. 

### 4.2.2 Deferrals

Another way to look at deferrals is to think of them as transactions where cash changes hands before revenue or expense is recognized, and you can think of them as either deferrals related to revenue or deferrals related to expenses. 

## 4.3 Long Loved Assets

### 4.3.1 Straight Line Depreciation

Expensese for long lived assets like property and equipment are realized over time. One way of doing this is depreciation.


Straight Line Depreciation - Yearly Depreciation = (GrossBookValue - SalvageValue)/UsefulLife

Accumulated depreciation is called a contra-asset account because its typical balance is contrary to other asset accounts. Accumulated depreciation increases with a credit and decreases with a debit. The balance in a contra-asset account is always a credit balance. The original cost of the asset less accumulated depreciation is the net book value of the asset.

Be sure to notice the difference between depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation.

+ Depreciation expense is a nominal, income statement expense account, which resets every period and simply shows the expense recognized in that period.
+ Accumulated depreciation is a real account that holds the cumulative balance of all depreciation expense recognized against the asset. 

### 4.3.2 Other Depreciation Methods

Double Declining Balance Depreciation - Recognizes greater losses early on and fewer losses as time increases.

### 4.3.3 Assest Disposal

#### Impairment
If you recognized too much loss then you credit an account called gain on Sale of Equipment

If you recognize more loss then you debit an account called Loss on Sale of Equipment, similar to an expense account. However losses are not part of the daily operation of company so they are not operating expenses.

### 4.3.4 Intangible and Amortization

**Intangible assets** - These are non-physical assets that provide some benefit to a business over a long period of time. 
 + Typical examples of intangible assets include patents, trademarks, and copyrights.

Intangible assest are converted into an expense over time using amortization.  The expense for intangible assets is called _amortization_.

Note: Good will is never amortized but tested for impairment annually. Under both GAAP and IFRS good will losses cannot be reversed.

When you think you might not be able to collect all your accounts receivables you set up an asset called Reserve for Bad debts which is a contra assets, and you also recognize an expense for bad debts.  When you find that some account is not collectible you credit accounts recievable and debit reserve for bad debt, the expense account is unchanged.

## 4.4 Inventory

### 4.4.1 Periodic vs Perpetual

Perpetutal Invetory System - Expense for inventory is recorded whenever the inventory is sold.

Periodic Invertory System - Peridiocally do inventory counts and then record the the invetory expenses.
 + Also done sometimes by perpetual systems to check for things like theft, and record those expenses


### 4.4.2 FIFO vs. LIFO

FIFO - First Items in inventory are the first items expensed.

LIFO - Last Items in Invetory or the first items expensed.

AVG - Every item is expensed at the average value of all items.

Individual - Each unit is seperate and tracked (car dealership)

### 4.4.3 Product Manufacturing

Product Costs  - Costs that a business incurs to buy, manufacture and deliver a good or service to a customer.  These costs associate themselves with a product
 + Record as assets and expensed at the time of sales.

Period Costs - Are all the other costs a company incurs while doing business, such as sales team salaries or office rent.
 + Record in the period they are incurred

Harder to figure out the difference between product cost and period costs for manufacturers than it is for retailers.


## Stages of Inventory
+ Once an item has been taken from raw materials into the production process it is considered work in process inventory or WIP.
 + Additional costs that are added to work in process inventory are labor and overhead costs. Labor cost is the wages paid to the factory workers.
 + Overhead includes additional cost items in the manufacturing process where it isnâ€™t practical to track those costs directly to a specific product. Think of manufacturing equipment depreciation or rent for the factory building.

+ The last category is finished goods. Costs: raw materials, labor, and factory overhead costs.


## 4.5 Deferred Taxes

### 4.5.1 Introduction
 Most companies have two books - Financial Reporting Books and Tax Books.
  + Often time companies will report different for tax reporting purposes than for a financial statement.

Taxable Income (Income Tax Return) and Gross Taxable Income(Financial Statement) are often difference.

### 4.5.2. Deferred Tax Liabilities

Depreciation - Maybe depreciated using straight line method for financial reporting but accelerated depreication for tax purposes.
 + This means the deprecitation tax reduction is different on FS than on Tax Statment.
 + When the difference between the tax depreciation is higher than financial statemtn
 +  Deferred Tax Liability - The lower tax payment in this year is offset by higher tax payment in future year.  In other words there is amount of tax taht is due in the future that is related to income reported in the current period.

Tax Expense = Income Before Taxes x Tax Rate
Tax Expense is the amount of tax that relates to activity that occurred during the current accounting period.

Taxes Payable = Taxable Income x Tax Rate
Taxes Payable is the amount of taxes you actually owe based on what the government says you owe.

Deferred Taxes = difference between Tax Expense and Taxes Payable due to a temporary timing difference
Deferred Tax accounts, whether they are liabilities or assets, always relate to subsequent years. Hence, they are not due and payable, in the case of deferred tax liabilities, or able to be netted against payments due, in the case of deferred tax assets, relating to the year that is being closed.

### 4.5.3 Deffered Tax Assets

Deferred Tax assests indicates you pre-paid some amount of taxes that has not yet been reported as income on the income statement.

Example: Bikram yoga recieves $300K prepayment for yoga class.  The 300K is immediately taxable, even tho the $300 is not recgonized as revenue on income statment meaning that taxable income might be higher than income before taxes

## 4.6 Review
