# Mod 6 - Analyzing Financial Statements

## 6.1 Introduction
### 6.1.1 Introduction

Ratios - Are used to analyze a business. There are differnt ratios one can use and they mean different things.

When using rations that included both balance sheet and income statement amounts generally use average of beginning and ending balances. You could do monthly or quarterly averages.  there is no 1 correct way to do it.

### 6.1.2 The DuPont Framework

Return on Equity = Net Income/Owners Equity

**DuPont Framework** 
 + Return on Equity  =  Profitability *  Efficiency * Leverage
 + Profitability - Measured using Profit Margin
  + Profit Margin = Net Income/Sales
 + Efficiency - Measured using Asset Turnover
  + Asset Turnover = Sales/Assets
 + Leverage - Measured using Leverage Ratio
  + Leverage Ratio = Assets/Equity
 + Allows one to see where the favorable or non favorable returns are coming from

## 6.2 Profitability
### 6.2.1 Profit Margin

Profit Margin = Net Income/Sales.

### 6.2.2 Gross Profit Margin

Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Sales

Ratio:
 + Gross Profit Per Square ft is important ratio.
 + One major retailer was seeing GP pr sqft decrease, but they were expanding square footage faster than that GPPS was decreasing.  Using ratio analysis Morgan Stanley was able to see this was unsustainable and short the stock.

### 6.2.3 EBIAT

**EBIAT** - Earnings before interest after taxes

## 6.3 Efficiency

### 6.3.1 Asset Turnover

_Asset turnover_ tells us the efficiency with with assets are being used to produce revenues. 

Asset Turnover  = Sales/Assets

### 6.3.2 Inventory Turnover

Note: NOT PART of DuPont Framework

Inventory turnover is a very useful ratio to understand how efficiently a business is managing its inventory levels.

Inventory Turnover = COGS/Average Inventory

Excess inventory cost money to store and uses up cash, so we want the ratio of costs of goods sold to average inventory to be high.

Days Sales in Invetory = 365/Inventory Turnover

### 6.3.3 Accounts Receivable Turnover

 Accounts Receivable Turnover or AR Turnover is indication of business' efficiency in collecting recievables from customers.

 Accounts Recieveable Turnover = Credit Sales/Average Accounts Receivable

 Average Collection Period = Average Accounts Recievable / Credit Sales Per Day

The average collection period, sometimes referred to as Days Sales Outstanding or Days Sales in Receivables, is the average number of days it took for a business to collect payment from a customer.  

Day Sales in Accounts Recievable or Average Collection Period = 365 / Accoounts Receivable Turnover.
 + Useful bc it can be compared to cash collection policy of the firm.  If payment is expected within a certain number of days bu thte Average collection period is greater then this represents an issue.

### 6.3.4 Accounts Payable Turnover 

Accounts Payable Turnover is an indicator of how lon git takes us to pay our vendors/creditors.

Accounts Payable Turnover = Credit Purchase/ Average Accounts Payable
 + OR COGS/Average Account Payable where that information is not available.

Days Purchases Outstanding = 365 / Accounts Payable Turnover.

### 6.3.5 Cash Conversion Cycle

Cash Conversion Cycle = Days Inventory + Average Collection - Days Purchases Outstanding

Cash Conversion cycle is am easure of lon git takes a business from the time it has to pay for inventory from it has to pay for inventory from its suppliers until it collects cash form its customers.

A positive cash conversion cycle means that a business takes longer than collect its recievables and sell its inventory than they time they take to pay their creditors. This means it will need more funding if it its a growing company. 

A negative cash conversion cycle means that business collects its recievabls and cells its inventory before it has to make its payments to creditors. This can be very benefical since company can maximize all available credit.

## 6.4 Leverage

### 6.4.1 Introduction

Leverage = Assets/Equity

Leverage measures the impact of all non-equity financing, or debt of all sorts, on the firm's ROE. 
 + If all of the assets are financed by equity, the multiplier is one.
 + As liabilities, which are forms of debt, increase, the multiplier increases from one, demonstrating the leverage impact of the debt.


### 6.4.2 Debt to Equity Ratio

Debt to Equity = Avg Total Liabilities / Average Total Equity

## 6.5 Other Ratios
### 6.5 Current Ratios

Current Ratio helps us understand business' ability to pay it short term oblications.

**Current Asset Ratio** =  Current Assets/Current Liabilities.

### 6.5.2 Quick Ratio

Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory)/Current Liabilities.
 + Similar to the current ratio but only for highly liquid assets.  Since inventory tends to be less liquid than other assets we remove it from calculations.


### 6.5.3 Interest Coverage Ratio

Interest Coverge Ratio - Also known as Times Interest Earned is good way to gauge how capable a business is of making the interst payments on its debt.

EBIT - Earnings before Interest and Tax
*Interest Coverage Ratio* = EBIT/Interest Expense

### 6.5.4 Seasonality

Many businesses have fluctations in their performance due to seasonality. For example after holiday season a retailer might have low inventory but a lot of cash.

Looking at a business we may observe cycles.  These are imortant to consider for both managment and for outside investors.

## 6.6 Impact of Policy Differences

### 6.6.1 Introduction

Different account practices often times require making adjustements to income statments before comparing ratios.

### 6.6.2 Typical Policy Differences

#### Revenue Recognition
This is a major issue in accounting world. There is a lot of room for judgement, for example if you have a liberal return policy where customer can return at any time for a full refund.  Or y ou have a membership fee that customer can cancel and recieve a full refund. What if the fee is non refundable?  How do you acocunt for this. 

#### Capitalizing Expenditures

Another important decision that can have impact is whether purchaseed assets should be expensed or capitalized. There are guidelines but considerable judgment has to be used.
+ How does a business deal with improvements and upgrades that extend the useful life of previously existing assets?
+ Does a business purchase and capitalize assets or lease their assets?
+ How does the level of what is considered material differ between businesses?

#### Depreciation 
How we depreciate an assets, and assumptions about deprecriation that change over time.

## 6.7 Summary of Ratio Analysis

Increasing any of the following: profit margin, asset turnover, and leverage results in a higher RoE.  However if the increase is driven by leverage then we've made the business riskier.

Common Size Balance Sheet - Another way to prepare financial statements from companies that are of differnet sizes is to divide each number n the balance sheet by total assets and each number in the income statement by sales.
