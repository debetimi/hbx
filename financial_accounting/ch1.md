## 1.2 Basic Transactions and Equations

### 1.2.1 Starting a Business
#### Transactions
+ Making an Equity Investment of X dollars
    + Increase Equity by X and Assets (Cash) by X
+ Taking a loan fo X dollars
    + Increase Liabilities by X and Assets (Cash) by X
+ Buying Equipment or Inventory with Cash
    + Increase Assets (Equipment/Inventory) by X. Decrease Assets (Cash) by X
 
### 1.2.2 Running a Business
+ Revenue - An inflow of assets/equity to a business
+ Expense - An outflow of assets/equity from a business

When recording transactions we can split them into revenue transactions and expense transactions
#### Transactions
+ Revenue: Sell an item that cost X for Y dollars
    + Increase Assets (Cash) by Y dollars. Increase Equity by Y dollars.
+ Expense: Sell an item that cost X for Y dollars 
    + Decrease Assets (Inventory) by X dollars, Decrease Equity by Y dollars

### 1.2.3 Buying on Credit
+ When purchasing on credit record the amount borrowed as a liability called "Accounts Payable"
#### Transactions
+ Buy an X dollars worth of leather on credit
  + Increase Assets (Inventory) by X dollars. Increase Liabilities (Accounts Payable) by X dollars

### 1.2.4 Selling on Credit
There are 2 Primary Methods of Accounts

1. Cash - Revenue is recognized when cash changes hands
2. Accrual - Revenue is recognized when it is *earned* and *realizable*
 + Realized - When the reciept of a payment, known as a *claim to cash* is reasonably certain
 + Earned - Good or service has been provided

Matching Principle - One of the principles behind Accrual Accounting which states that expenses should be recognized in the same period in which the related revenue is recognized rather than when the related cash is paid
#### Transactions
+ Suppose Cardullo's sold $700 of gift baskets to Cambridge Savings Bank. The items in the gift baskets were purchased for $400 and Cambridge Savings Bank has 30 days to pay for this order after they receive it. 
 + Increase Assets (Claim to Cash) by $700, Increase Equity by ($700)
 + Using matching priniciple we must recognize expenses at the same time. Decrease Assets (Inventory) by $400, and Equity by $400.
+ 30 days later Cardullo's recieves payment for $700.
 + Assets: Increase Cash by $700 and Decrease Claim-to-Cash by $700
