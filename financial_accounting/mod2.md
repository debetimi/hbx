**Chart of Accounts** - List of all a business's accounts.

### 2.1.2 Debit and Credit

**IMPORTANT**: "For our purposes, debits mean left, and credits mean right. Debits go in the left column, and credits go in the right column of journal entries, T-accounts, and trial balances. It really is just that simple. The terms do not mean increase or decrease, they do not mean good or bad. They simply mean left and right. This is simply an accounting rule based on a historical convention. As weâ€™ve mentioned before, many terms in the accounting world have a different definition than they do in everyday language. So in this context, debits and credits do NOT relate to other everyday terms you might be familiar with, like debit cards and credit cards, or buying on credit, or taking out credit. In the context of this course, debits mean left, and credits mean right"

**Debit** - _Increases_ Asset Balances and _Decreases_ Liabilities and Equity.

**Credit** - _Decreases_ Asset Balances and _Increase_ Liabilities and Equity.

|      |Assest|Liabilities|Equity| Revenues | Expenses |
|:-----|:----:|:---------:|:----:|:--------:|:--------:|
|Debit | +    | -         | -    | -        | +        |
|Credit| -    | +         | +    | +        | -        |

NOTE: Revenues and Expenses should be considered subsections of Equity.

**Double Entry Accounting** - A system of accounting that uses both credits and debits. Entries on the left columns are debits and entries on the right column are credits.

### 2.1.3 Journal Entries

Every Transaction can be visualized as a Journal Entry.

Some things to remember about Journal Entries:
+ Every journal entry has one line for each account affected
+ There are always at least two accounts affected
+ The total of all debits must equal the total of all credits
+ Journal entries are generally formatted with the debits first, then credits
+ Each journal entry has a date associated with the entry

Example: Cardullo's buys $135 worth of candy bars

|Date|Accounts|Debit|Credit|
|:---:|:----|:---|:---|
|06/01/13|Inventory<br>Cash|$135<br><br>|<br>$135|

### 2.1.4 T-Accounts

T-Accounts are used to show the debit and credit of single account over time. The are used to easily visuals and track the value of a specific account over time.

Example: Utility Expense

||Debit|Credit|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Begining Balance | 4250 ||
|06/03/2013| 900 | |
|Ending Balance| 3350 ||

## 2.3 The Trial Balance

## 2.3.1 Building a Trial Balance

**Trial Balance** - List of all a business's accounts that are balances of the debt and the amount in each account. The total of all the debit balance accounts must equal all of the credit balance account

The balances from all the T-Accounts are listed in the Trial Balance. Expense/Asset accounts will typically have debit balances and Liability/Equity/Revenue accounts will typically have credit balances.

Trial balance - The trial balance gets its name from the idea that it provides a test, or trial, to make sure that total debits are equal to total credits.
