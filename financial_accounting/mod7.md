# Module 7 - Forecasting and Valuation

## 7.1 Introduction
## 7.2 Pro-Forma Financial Statements 
### 7.2.1 Percent of Sales Forecasting

Forecasts are predictive statements of what a companie performance is expected to look.
 + To create a forecast you have to consider many things, costs, supply chain, economic environment, past performance, etc.

### 7.2.2 Property, Plant, and Equipment

Capital Investments - Investments made in Property, Plant, and Equipment.

### 7.2.3 Borrowings and Interest Expense

Forecasting interest expense can be complicated if a company is borrowing money to finance their operations.  Because borrow impacts interest expense, which impacts borrowing(if you are using this pay your interest expense since paying loan interest is part of operation)


Circular Issues - Borrowings are used to etermine interest expense which impacts net income and retained earnings, but retain earnings are used to calculate borrowings.

### 7.2.4 Income Tax Expense

Various accounts wont vary directly with sales. For examle, income expense.

### 7.2.5 Equity and Cash
Often times you calculate either equity (for startups) or cash (for stable businesses) last simply using Assets = Liabilities + Equity, having already calculated all remaining account balances.

Retained Earnings += Net Income - Dividends declared

### 7.2.6 Sensitivity Analysis
+ Changing one assumption in a forecase has ripple effects throughout the entire forecast.  
+ The forecast should be used as a foundation for decision making.
+ Don't hard code values into forecast use excel formulas.

## 7.3 Projecting Free Cash Flow

### 7.3.1 Projecting Free Cash Flows

Free Cash Flow - An amount meant to represent the cash flows that a company could be expected to generate from its normal operations for a given period without considering the impact of how the business is financed. In this course we use the following formula to calculate free cash flows: FCF = (1-t) x EBIT + Dep – Capx - &Delta;NWC where t is the tax rate, Dep is depreciation expense, Capx is capital expenditures and &Delta;NWC is the change in net working capital.

EBIAT - Earnings before interest after taxes = (1 - t) x EBIT

### 7.3.4 Capital Expenditures
Captial Expenditures - Refers to when cash is actually paid for property and equipment regardless of depreciation recognized on the asset.

### 7.3.5 Net Working Capital
Net working capital refers to the business having cash tied up in operations. As the business grows, it will typically need more cash to fund day to day operations. For example, as a business increases its sales, and services more customers, it will often need to increase the amount of inventory that it carries. This is cash that will be dedicated to the business and won’t be available for other purposes.

&Delta;NWC - Change in Net Working Capital is calculated as the current year's net of current assets and current liabilities less the prior year's net of current assets and current liabilities.

## 7.4 Valuation

### 7.4.1 Time Value of Money

A dollar recieved today is worth more than a dollar recieved a year from now.  This is because of the interest rate.
 + Investment
 + Inflation
 + Less Certain

Cash flows in differnt time periods need to be convert to discounted to present values.

### 7.4.2 Terminal Value

How do we estimate  value of seemingly endless cash flow or a perpetuity.

#### Gordon Growth Model
PV(perpetuity) = Cash Flow Final Year of Project/(r - g) 
 + r - discount rate
 + g - growth rate

### 7.4.3 Net Present Value

Net Present Value - The net present value is a calculation of the present values of all the cash inflows and outflows of a project or investment. The result is a single number that gives a good indication of what a business or a particular investment is worth today.

Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) - The discount rate which represents the cost to the business of raising funds. This rate will vary from one business to the next, but is the discount rate that many companies use in the NPV calculation. If a project or investment cannot return more than the WACC, the company would lose money on the investment.

### 7.4.4 Other Measures

IRR - Internal Rate of Return - The discount rate that sets the net present value (NPV) of a project equal to zero. The IRR allows us to find the percentage rate that would be earned for a given set of cash flow.

Payback Period - Tells us how fast investor can expect to have money return.  This is metric is more useful for someone interested in limiting the downsides. Ignores time value of money.

Negative NPV means that IRR < WACC.
NPV = 0, IRR = WACC.

### 7.4.5 Sensitivity

Sensitivy - How the analysis reacts to changes in the discount rate. This is very difficult to do.
 + Example Professor Narayanan gave his students an exmaple of 3 places to invest and the class was split roughly 1/3 for each. Each made assumptions that made their choice the better investment.

## 7.5 Determining Relevant Cash Flows

### 7.5.1 Determining Relevant Cash Flows

When trying to determine NPV only include relevant cash flows. That means only include cash inflows and outflows that would arrive if the project is undertaken.  Do not include costst that would be incurred with or without the project are considered sunk and should not be included.
