+ Cash paid to manufacture/vendor
+ Cash paid to employees/players (sports)

### 5.2.2 Operating Income: Direct Methods

Add all the cash collections and substract all of the cash disbursements.

*Note:* This is not the amount of expense recognize over this period but rather the actual cash that was paid out. 

Typical list cash inflows before out flows

##  5.3 Indirect Method
### 5.3.1 Indirect Method

_Start from the income statement and make adjustments to undo the impact of the accruals that were made during the period._

For example - Accruals and Deferrals need to be adjusted.  Depreciation and amortization lower net income, and they need to be added back to net income since no actualy cash was lost over this period.

### 5.3.2 Gains and Losses
Gains and losses show up on the income statement and need to be removed from net income in operating section since they dont represent operating cash flows.

### 5.3.3 Asset Accruals

Accruals need to be adjusted.  For example take a look at the balance sheet.  If the recievables accounts have increased that means that we have recognized income for cash we have yet to recieved and need to reflect that by decreasing cash in operating section by amount.  Conversely if account receivable balance goes down then that means we've collected cash for revenue we've previously recognized and need to increase the cash in the operating section.

If inventory goes up that represents cash paid for inventory that is not recognized as an expense.  We need to decrease the 

### Why the Heck Use Indirect Method?
Reconciliation of Net Income and Operating Cash flows provides useful information.

### 5.3.4 Liability Accruals

The exact opposite of assets.  If an account increased that means were recognized benefits before paying cash so we have to add that back to the operating cash flow.

+ An increase in operating current assets is subtracted from net income.
+ A decrease in operating current assets is added to net income.
+ An increase in operating current liabilities is added to net income.
+ A decrease in operating current liabilities is subtracted from net income.  

Under indirect method, if prepare decides to not included interest in operating section an adjustment must be made to remove it since it is included in in net income for the period.

Most companies use the indirect method to report cash flows.
 + This is because reconcilliation of net income to operating cash flows is still required under both IFRS and GAAP
 + This is easier to create because it uses info from existing financial statements while direct uses financial transactions.
