# Module 4 Markets

## 4.1 Market Outcomes

### 4.1.1 What is a Market

### 4.1.2 Demand and Supply Curves

**Market Outcome** - The market price for something is where the demand curve and the supply curve meet.
 + This is because supply equals demand, you have an equilibrium.

If there is an excess of demand, then willingness to pay increases.
 + In the lawyer example if there is an excess of demand for lawyers, law firms will be willing to pay more.
 + If firms pay more then more people will be available, so wages will fall.  This cycle will continue until you hit the equilibrium of supply equalling demand.


### 4.1.3 The Concept of Market Equilibrium

Equilbrium - There are no buyers who are willing to pay for the product but can’t get it and no sellers who produce the product but can’t sell it"

The sum of consumer and producer surplus is maximized at the market outcome.

When prices are at the demand-supply intersection, there is no buyer or seller who would have liked to transact at that price, but couldn’t. 

### 4.1.4 The Magic of Markets

"Every trade that can occur will occur voluntarily" - Adam Smith

The example of a pencil - Has tens of diferrent materials that all interact to come together in the creation of a pencil.

Everything is interelated - If oil prices drops, countries might build more infrastructure that requires oil, like a desalination plant, which would lead to more agriculture.  

Prices coordinate interaction between buyers and sellers.

### 4.1.5 Equilibrium: Short-Run vs. Long-Run

Netflix had amazing growth 2000 - 2011, but analysts where still skeptial about its future prospects. This is because a lof the growth before was form DVD business but as streaming was taking off, it was likey to cannibalize hte DVD business and since barriers to entry was lower the would be more competition.

As a manager you should think about what equilibrium will look like not just today but in the future.
 + Who might be the new players
 + What might be the competitive products that might arise.

What does firm performance look like over time?
 + The results were dramatic—and sobering. They indicate a fairly strong “reversion to the mean” in performance over time. If anything, today’s high performers are likely to do far worse tomorrow; the opposite is the case for poor performers.

Looking at perfomance today tells you little about performance tomorrow.

### 4.1.6 Demand and Supply Shocks

Perfect competition - The supply curve looks essentially flat. This happens when there is a lot of competition and competitors are able to copy advantages of leading company to the point where all companies look the same.

Frictions - Things that can reverse the dynamic of perfect competition.  Things like network effects, scale, regulation, patents, and innovative capabilities.

## 4.2 Markets and Fairness

### 4.2.1 Bruce Springsteen's Concert Prices

Springsteen annoyed by high prices of concerts created a price ceiling on his tickets.  This creates a shortage of tickets since there are more ppl willing to buy than there is supply at the cieling price.

Price ceiings - lead to market shortages that reverse the intended effect of the ceiling by driving up prices on secondary market.

### 4.2.2 Hurricane Sandy

+ The infrastructure disruptions meant that, at any given price, it was harder (and costlier) to bring gasoline into the New York City area. This was equivalent to steepening the supply curve of gasoline. 

#### Anti Gouging
+ Essential are price cielings 

Queues are inefficient
+ There are lots of trading opportunites to trade places in queues.

Interesting Result from Queue Experiment: The more you offer someone to jump the queue increases percent chance you get to cut, however people re less likely to actually take the money since they dont want to profit off your desperation.
 + Ppl are aware of the social implications


### 4.2.3 The Minimum Wage

Think of Min Wage like a price cieling.
 + The result of minimum wage is a surplus of supply, or a more unemployment.

### 4.2.4 Measuring Fairness

Examine what prices are fair to what playes along demand and supply curves.
 
### 4.2.5 The Distribution of Surplus

Who captures most of the producer surplus, the shareholders or the workers?
 + The cost of labor is already included in supply curve so the surplus is captured by the shareholders.

 Efficiency vs Fairness
  + Efficienty increase the total pie available to everyone
   + However some parties get much more of the pie than everyone
  + Efficiency vs Fairness is always a trade off

## 4.3 Applications

### 4.3.1 Online Advertising

 + What are the sources of supply and demand in this market—who’s buying and who’s selling?
 + What drives the shape (or elasticity) of the supply and demand curves? That is, how sensitive is each side of the market to changes in price and what factors drive this sensitivity?
 + What forces could shift supply and demand in this market

 WTP (Advertising) = Avg Profit * Expected Increase in quantity demanded.
 + Demand curve is downward sloping because additional ads are increasingly less effective.

 Supply Curve for Advertising -The space used to adverstised comes at the expense ospace for content.  The more you advertise the more viewers you will turn off from reading your content so the opportunity cost of advertising is lost users.

Online advertising is revered because you can target specific customes so the WTP of companies is much higher.
 + Coupled with more supply of ad space (the internet) prices for advertising (CPMs) actually fell despite online ads providing greater benefits.

Prediction of Online Book Vending
 + Predicted that selling books online would reduce the market for traditional sellers since the supply increase would be large enough as to push the prices down enough to where brick and mortar was no longer a viable option
 + Productive availability exploded, but there was too much product leading to clutter.  Consumers couldn't find what they wanted online, or didnt know what was good, instead they went to the brick and mortars and purchased the books from authors with good brand recognition.
 + Changing the supply curve in this instance, had an affect on the demand curve.  Always consider both.

### 4.3.2 Cigarette Taxes

Mike Moore proposed excise tax on cigarettes as form of fine on companies.
  + Although the intended effect is to greatly reduce the profits of cigarette companies, they pass the costs on to their consumers by simply shifting up the supply curve.

**Economic Incidence** - The true burden of tax.

The true incidence of any tax is just the elasticity of the supply and demand curves.

More inelastic supply and demand curves means the tax has more effect on both consumers and producers respectively.

There is difference betwee the _legal_ or _statuatory_ incidence and the true incidence of taxes.

### 4.3.3 Exchange Rates

What drives the demand for foreign currency?

Example: TI planned to increase number of imported semiconductors it imported from China.  To do so, it needs to buy from Chinese producers in RMB or CNY the Chinese currency. This increases demand in CNY/USD market.

Who supplies the RMB?

Possibly a Chinese firm looking to import US goods.  If the Chinese and Americans have a _balanced trade_ these sources of demand cancel out.  There should be equal values of CNY and USD to trade.

Why are speed limits not 10 MPH on highway
 + We know that lower speed limits reduces accidents but we make a trade of between our willingness to pay for preventing accidents and the cost of driving slower.
 + We don't reduce speed limit to the level where accident rates are minimized, but to the where the benefit and cost of changing it are equalized.  Equilibrium

### 4.3.4 The China Growth Miracle

+ In order to stimulate growth, China's central banks began offering low interest loans. Since the capital is subsidized, it increases the gains from hirign additional workers.

+ China joined the WTO which doesn't allow protecting industries by providing subsidized loans. How could they continue to allow growth?
 + From the exchange rate we understand that if exchange rate is higher then products from that country look cheaper.
 + China should want to hold their currency down. They do this by purchasing a lot of american goods.

 + China start purchasing bonds. The keeps US interest rates low since Chinese capital is flooding into buy the bonds.  This eventually produces the property boom in the united states.

## 4.4 Creating Markets

Can create markets for anything.  Price reflects expected return of securities.
