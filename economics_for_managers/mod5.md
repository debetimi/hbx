# Module 5 - Competition and Differentiation

## 5.1 Pricing By Monopoly: The Pricing of Epogen

### 5.1.1 Module Introduction

Monopoly - Doesn't mean complete control but useful to think of as situation in when a firm has substantial influence over the pricing of its profits.
 + There are global, national, regional, and even local monopolies.

### 5.1.2 Pricing Epogen

Amgen goes public in 1980 trying to clone human EPO gene which helps to stimulate bbone marrow to alleviate anemia suffered by dialysis.

Amgen had spent 300MM in R&D and was the exlcusive company manufacturing Epogen, so they had pricing power. Since it was a vital drug however, how to price it was not an easy decision.

They looked at competitors.  They looked at what the value they were delivering, a person getting to work for another year etc.  They looked at fairness, what is the maximum level they didnt want to go above.  They also looked at what the govnerment would think.

### 5.1.3 Optimal Pricing

Even in a competitive market, not everyone can particiate. Some people will be left out at the variable cost.

### 5.1.4 The Concept of Marginal Revenue 
Marginal Customer - Customer on the margin of buying and not buying.

Inframarginal Customers - Customers already buying at the price you charge.

Marginal Revenue - What you gain or loss from changing the prices.

Profit is Maximized where Marginal Revenue is equal to marginal cost.

For competive firms, since they dont have all the market share, the marginal revenues are often helped by continually lowering prices and capturing customers.
    + For competitive markets, marginal revenue is equal to demand curve.
    + Competitve firms price where MC = MR
    + The next firm does this and it continues until MC = MR = Cost of Goods

#### Interim Summary

1. Most pricing decisions confront tradeoff between volume and profit.  Price lower and firm might gain more customers but you loserrevenue on inframarginal customers.

2. Monopolist the marginal revenue curve is not the same as the demand curve because there is no competition.

3. Competive market, the marginal revenue curve is the demand curve.

### 5.1.5 From Textbook Pricing to the Real World: Part I 

+ fixed costs do not have any affect on how to price. 

+ Why are bio-pharmaceutical returns so high?
    + Because the risks are huge. 
    + Winners cover the loss from the losers.

### 5.1.6 From Textbook Pricing to the Real World: Part II

+ Profitability for a dialysis center is affected by how medicare reimburses your costs. 
    + The largest consumer of medical services are the elderly so that means Medicare payment schedules are very important.

At first dialysis centers would get payment for the government because they got payments for dialysis patients and for use of Epogen.  After a while the government merged the payments into one meaning there was no payment for specific use of empogen.  Dialysis centers went from wanting to use Epogen to not wantng to use epogen as it was not specifically reimbursed and very expensive.

Tradeoff between: widespread access, limiting reimbursements, and providing the right incentives for quality service.

## 5.2 Price Discrimination

### 5.2.1 Perfect Price Discrimination

The previous analysis about inframarginal customers and marginal revenues made an assumption that everybody had the same price.
 + In reality, there are many different prices there are prices for buying in bulk, coupons, prices for membership like Sams Club or Amazon prime.  And a whole host of other things.

This is known as __pricing discrimination__ 

First degree pricing discrimination requires ability to charge different customers different prices.

"Dead weight loss" - Profit loss from a transaction that could have happened but didnt.  For example if you price a product at above the willingness to pay for a specific person. That WTP - Cost is dead weight loss.

You can escape this by doing variable pricing, which we see all the time. Since WTP decrease with marginal units you can price marginal units at a lower cost.

### 5.2.2 Two-Part Tariffs

Two part tariff consists of a fixed fee and price per unit.

It is challenged to figure out where to set per unit prices and fixed fees. Changing either will affect dead weight costs.

Tariffs provide flexibility over perfect price discrimination, with a fixed fee you have a broader range you can set price at and recover optimal monopoly pricing.  You also don't need as much info on WTP as perfect pricing.

The price with the higher upfront fee is better when the profit is the same because the income is more guaranteed. So if a fee of 20 and cost of 5 and a fee of 15 and cost of 10 workout to the same profit, then its better to charge 20.


### 5.2.3 Two-Part Tariffs with Many Customers

When you have two types of customers High Customers (High WTP) and Low Customers.  You can only capture the full surplus of the Low customers.


### 5.2.4 Price Discrimination through Self-Selection

_Third degree price discrimination_ is practice of charging customers different prices based on observable characteristics e.g. race, age, and gender.

It is hard to implement third degree price discrimination because in many instances it is socially unnacceptable, and it is also hard to figure out who are your Low Type and High Type customers.

Coupons are a good example of price discrimination. Some customers throw away coupons other customers will save and use them.

Airlines - Couch vs Airlines.  Business Travelers generally have a higher WTP than vacation travelers.  Airlines would like to charge business travels more, but they can't know in advance who is a business traveler and who isn't.  So they design two differnt products, Coach and Business class, and let customers self select.

_Second-degree price discrimination_ - When customer self select into a product offering.

### 5.2.5 Bundled Pricing: Part I

Bundled Pricing - Pricing different products together.

Excersize:
+ 1 Journalist, 1 Analyst
+ Journalist: $10 WTP word : $2 WTP Excel
+ Analyst: $2 WTP word : $10 WTP Excel
+ Marginal Cost is 0

Perfect Price Discrimination: you charge each their WTP for respective item. 
 + Profit: $24

Single Price Monopoly Pricing: Charge $10 for each
 + Profit: $20

Bundling: Charge 12 for the combo
 + Profit: $24

### 5.2.6 Bundled Pricing: Part II

When there is negative corellation across customers, bundling is very effective.

Looking at customers by preference for individual products, and they look very differnt.  However look for customers WTP for the bundle and they begin to look much smoother.

## 5.3 Simple Strategies for Differentiation: The Entry Strategy of Bonobos

### 5.3.1 Differentiating in Apparel Retailing

Most companies don't exist in perfect competition or monopoly.  Most companies exist in between and work on differentiation.

Question: Would you rather be different or similar to your main competitor?  And if you were to be different where would you be different.

Brand or Channel

Brand vs Retail: You have your brand or you sell many brands. (Upstream or Downstream)

Channel: Brick and Mortar vs Online

Vertical Retailing:
+ You sell your own brand.

### 5.3.3 When Competitive Similarity Pays

Pizza Example: It pays to be similar if you customers do not care to differentiate between you and a competitor and just do what is most convenient. For example two pizza shops on the beach -- customers go to the closer one.

### 5.3.4 Competing on Prices: Action and Reaction

What happens if you place truck at same spot as pizza restaurant:
 + Price competition until prices are set at variable cost.
 + Since you two pizza-slingers are identical—same product in the same location—the inevitable price war leaves both of you with no profits.

When thinking about differentiating think about if what you are doing can be responded to quickly by your competitors.  If competitors can react quickly, even though you created this new value, you wont get to capture it all.

### 5.3.5 The Benefits of Differentiation

If you lower prices and gain customers, you lose profits on inframarginal customers.

### 5.3.6 Where and How to Differentiate

In the pizza example, differentiation on location protects them from price competition.  When the pizza shops are co-located prices are driven to marginal.  However when they are located in different spots, then they can charge higher prices.

*Competitive Advantage requires differentiation.*
 + The key question to answer is _where_ do you want to be different.
  + What to be differnt on things that really matter to your customers or suppliers.


### 5.3.7 Choosing Prices and Locations
### 5.3.8 The Competitive Strategy of Bonobos
+ The went after mens market as the primary market

Who is their customer
 + 25 - 50
 + Favorite Brand: Hugo Boss
 + Favorite Movie: Shawshank, The Godfather

How did they differentiate
 + Offered lots of different sizes and cuts, odd waist sizes and 3 differnt inseams.
 + This works because you can come in and try clothes, but you dont have to stock it.

Bonobos: fit, service, fun
 + Great customer service
 + 1:1 Appointment when you come in and shop
 + Customized fit

Bonobos: Bundle
 + Clothes & Experiences of buying clothes.

Kindle vs Sony e-reader
+ what made the kindle more popular was the fact that you could download wirelessly. 
 + A better purchasing experience was the key differentiator.
