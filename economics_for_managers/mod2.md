# 2.1.4 Introductions to Auctions

Introduces competition amongsts buyers and changes incentives to reveal willingness to pay truthfully since ther are consequences for your answers.

Different Auction Types
    + Open Outcry or English - All bids are public and the highest bidder wins
    + Vickrey Auction - Named after a Columbia University Professor this type of auction the bids are sealed and the highest bidder pays the price of the second highest bid.

# 2.1.5 English and Vickrey Auctions


**English Auctions** - English auctions are fairly effective at revealing WTP of all participants except the highest bidder
    + With advanced knowledge a seller would start bidding right at the WTP of the eventual winner.

**Vickrey Auctions** - Effectively give you same result as English Auctions ~ sell at 2nd highest WTP.

# 2.1.6 Sealed First Price Auctions

Since the winner pays the highest bid, there is incentive for everyone to lower his/her bid since if you have the highest WTP you will feel you've overpaid.

Essentially you get the same results as either Vickrey or English.

Example: eBay vs Yahoo Auctions
 + Ebay auction have fixed ending time
 + Yahoo auctions end 5 min after final bid.  Bidders didnt like this system because they couldn't time bidding to their favor since there was no last second bidding.
 + Buyers didnt like using it so fewer sellers used it and it was closed down.

# 2.1.7 Auctions vs Fixed Price

Tickets Example: Holzman says auctions aren't attractive because of the uncertainty, you won't know if you've won.

Fixed Price better when certainty is demanded. Think buying househould good like detergent, or cleaning formulas.
