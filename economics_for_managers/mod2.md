# Module 2 - Strategies for Assessing and Increasing Demand

# 2.1 - Direct Approaches for Assessing Demand
# 2.1.1 - Intro
# 2.1.2 - Surveys

Surveys have various advantages including

+ You can get large scale data
+ Survey a broad pool of people
+ Elicit aggregate preferences
+ Cheap

Problems with Surveys

+ If answering truthfully means you will pay more, you are likely to lie.
+ Bad for new or unfamiliar things.
+ Unrepresentative samples.

# 2.1.3 Focus Groups

Advantages of Focus Group

+ More focused!
+ More time to ask follow up questions and correct things.
+ You get to know WHY of things.

Disadvantages

+ Time consuming

Best market research uses surveys for MACRO trends and focus groups for DETAIL

Selection Bias: You want to be careful to not only ask customers, but also non customers to learn about your market.

This module is very important for those working in CPG.

# 2.1.4 Introductions to Auctions

Introduces competition amongsts buyers and changes incentives to reveal willingness to pay truthfully since ther are consequences for your answers.

Different Auction Types

+ Open Outcry or English - All bids are public and the highest bidder wins
+ Vickrey Auction - Named after a Columbia University Professor this type of auction the bids are sealed and the highest bidder pays the price of the second highest bid.

# 2.1.5 English and Vickrey Auctions


**English Auctions** - English auctions are fairly effective at revealing WTP of all participants except the highest bidder

+ With advanced knowledge a seller would start bidding right at the WTP of the eventual winner.

**Vickrey Auctions** - Effectively give you same result as English Auctions ~ sell at 2nd highest WTP.

# 2.1.6 Sealed First Price Auctions

Since the winner pays the highest bid, there is incentive for everyone to lower his/her bid since if you have the highest WTP you will feel you've overpaid.

Essentially you get the same results as either Vickrey or English.

**Revenue Equivalence of Auctions** - All forms of auctions return roughly the same revenue.

Example: eBay vs Yahoo Auctions

+ Ebay auction have fixed ending time
+ Yahoo auctions end 5 min after final bid.  Bidders didnt like this system because they couldn't time bidding to their favor since there was no last second bidding.
+ Buyers didnt like using it so fewer sellers used it and it was closed down.

# 2.1.7 Auctions vs Fixed Price

Tickets Example: Holzman says auctions aren't attractive because of the uncertainty, you won't know if you've won.

Fixed Price better when certainty is demanded or there is no time constraint. Think buying househould good like detergent, or cleaning formulas.

If a seller knows WTP well, the will likely set a fixed price. If buyers WTP are far apart then fixed price is better.

 + Auctions generate more revenue when WTP are relatively close together.
 + Auctions are good fo old items, where WTP is likely to range and not well known.


Ebay: Auctions went from 90%  in 1999 to 20% in 2012 of eBay Transactions.

 + One hypothesis is mobile and social media led to this decline
 + People spend less time on mobile sessions.
 + Ebay used to be a leisure activity that has been replaced with social.

# 2.1.8 Bidding for Oil

 Bidding for tract of land with oil. Neither bidder nor seller knows exact worth of land.

 Winner Curse - The winner of an auction tends to overbid. Unless everyone's information is perfect the winner is the most optimistic.

 + The winner's curse will only occur if the market is for a "Common Value Asset" where the thing you are bidding on is worth about the same to everyone.

One way to avoid the winner's curse is to bid lower than appraiser's estimate.

One way to win a bid is to take your original bid and apply a statistical or algebraic model using outside infomration to determine how much to pare down the bid.

# 2.1 Summary
Auctions are usually better for sellers than buyer since buyers are less likely to capture a surplus (win at below market value).

## 2.2 Indirect Approaches for Assesing Demand

### 2.2.1 Revealed Preferences

Instead of asking customers questions using surveys you look at their past actions and histories.  

*Revealed Preference* - Looking at history of consumer that reveals a consumers preferences.

 + Can use this to infer WTP

#### Demand Curves and Missing Variables
When looking at demand curves you need to consider missing variables. For example if you are looking at prices and sales of an item at different stores you have to consider if stores sold out, preventing new customers.

#### Demand Estimation
Estimation - When trying to do demand estimation and looking at prices and quantities sold we need ot make sure that the data that we are looking at is showing us a demand curve and not a supply curve.

This problem is known as *Identification*. Identifying whether or not demand or supply is the variable controlling the shape of your data.

### 2.2.2 Experiments
Have 3 days to sell ticket best guess for price is $100 but not confident? How do your price, $80, $100, $120?
 + Price tickets high.  If nobody bites after a day then you know that $120 above the WTP and you can lower price. You've gained information about WTP.
 + Pricing at $80 guarantees quick sales but you will leave money on the table. You've gained no new information about WTP.
 + So basically you can *Price to Generate Revenues* or *Price to Generate Information*

Question: What is better higher or lower conversion rates on Google?
 + Answer: A high rate might indicate you are giving *too* good a deal and the customers are capturing benefit but you aren't.


### 2.2.3 Experiments: Design Principles
 1. Avoid confirmation bias by selecting a value you already know to be correct. For examle we know the tickets will sell at $80. Instead formulate a hypothesis and try to disprove it. If you can't then you are correct. Otherwise, you will learn new information to correct the hypothesis.
 2. Isolate key features. Vary experiment incrementally don't vary multiple features at once because the combined affect of the change might obscure the affect from changing only one of the variable.
 3. Focus on the right question.  Make sure you ask *clearly* what you want to know. 

 Forced Savings Product
 - Takes money away from you that you can't withdraw

 How would you figure out if there was demand?
    + What they actually did was offer a random sample of the customers the ability to use the account
    + They kept the interest rates equivalent so it was apples to apples.

### 2.2.4 Experiments: Randomization

+ Randomization prevents sample bias.
    + This make sure hidden variables are removed and variable under test is isolated.

### Summary
In summary, a well-designed experiment:

+ avoids confirmation bias
+ isolates key features of the hypothesis
+ focuses on the most important question
+ avoids the problem of missing variables through randomization.

## 2.3 Conjoint Analysis (Case: New York Times Paywall)

## 2.3.1 Conjoint Analysis

**Conjoint Analysis** -  A statistical technique used in market research to determine how people value different attributes (feature,function, benefits) that make up an individual product or service.

Case: NYT introduced Digital Paywall in 2011. They need to deterimine WTP of consumers in print, smartphone or tablet formats.

Quality Pricing Circulation Strategy - Charge optimal amount that people are willing to pay for their print product. They charge $800 for year of subscription vs $400 at most for competitiors.

 + iPad forced them to rethink their plan to launch pay model for online content.
  + Plan for charing just for website content was no longer going to work due to nature of ipad.
  + Needed to think about bundling all productions.
 + MBB says: Needed to use conjoint analysis to figure out what consumers wanted most

One way you can test how customers value feature is to ask them to rank products that represent all available options
 + This presents too many options

There are two key elements of conjoint analysis.

 + Pair-wise rankings: First, rather than ask a customer her preference across 27 (or more) different products, the conjoint approach requests a comparison only across two or three offerings at any one time.
 + Infer values from rankings: Second, rather than asking a customer to fill out her dollar value for each feature-combination, in conjoint analysis we don’t even need to ask her that. Instead, we infer the dollar value she might assign to any product based on her rankings.
 + When you create the matrix you assign value a wait, then u add the weight of the row and column.  This is known as the *part-worth*

**Parts Worth** - an implied numeric value that users attach to each feature of a product.

When you create a product add the parts worths to get total utility.

This means that the value selection is VERY important.

### NYT
When The New York Times ran a conjoint analysis to design their online paywall, they discovered the preference for the "iPad only" version was strong enough that it would draw a lot of readers away from the “print only" version. In other words, an iPad-only offering had the potential to cannibalize print subscription readers. That led to a major decision—one that ultimately impacted the success of the paywall—to bundle a digital subscription with the print subscription. Anyone who bought a print subscription would get digital access for free.

### 2.3.3 Applications of Conjoint Analysis

Segmenting Customers - You can plot preference vs preferences on a chart.

### Summary of Conjoint Analysis
+ It helps you focus on the features that consumers want and focus how you make tradeoffs in product.

## 2.4 Strategies for Increasing Demand

### 2.4.1 Strategy 1: Advertising

You can run ads that highlight the characteristics that were most popular in the conjoint analysis.

100's of Billions are spent on ads every year for

 + Brand Building
 + Increasing Awareness
 + Product Information
 + Brainwashing

Advertising shifts the demand curve out

 + At a giving price, customers should be willing to buy more items than before because now they have more informatin


#### Advertising Elasticity of Demand (AED)

**Advertising Elasticity of Demand* -The percent change in quantity demanded that results from a percent increase in advertising spending.

Some industries, like beer, the AED is 0.  However individual brands have an incentive to advertise because consumers are not particularly loyal.

### 2.4.2 Types of Advertising

+ When there is a fixed pool of customer then advertising is a zero sum game.  If ads increase your demand, they will decreases your opponents.
+ Politics is a zero sum game, so there is a strong incentive for negative advertising against competitors.

### 2.4.3 Strategy 2: Complements

+ Differentiate yourself from similar offerings.

**Substitute** - If there is a substitute for you product then WTP(A + B) < WTP(A) + WTP(B)
 + If there is a substitute for your product people are less willing to pay for both products than they are to pay for the sum of the individual products.  Think Cable and Satellite.

**Complements** - WTP(A + B) > WTP(A) + WTP(B)
 + A complement is something that increases the WTP of a customer when bundled.  Think pop corn at movie.  People are willing to pay more for popcorn if there is a movie involved.
 + Hardware/Software, Hotdogs/Ketchup.

As a comany you want _substitutes__ to be as expensive as possible.  And you want you complements to be as cheap as possible.

Stubhub is a substitue and a complement to ACE.

### 2.4.4 Examples of Complements
+ Rum and Coke
+ Cars and Roads
+ Music and Smartphones
+ Printers and Printer Ink

Michelin: Tire company that also produces travel guidebookss.
 + Travel and tires are complementary.

#### Cross Price Elasticity of Demand

When two products are substitutes the cross price elasticity is positive.  When to products are complements then then cross price elasticity is negative.  If two products are unrelated then CPE is roughly 0.

Cross Price Elasticity of Demand = (&Delta;Q<sub>A</sub>/Q<sub>A</sub>)/(&Delta;P<sub>B</sub>/P<sub>B</sub>)

Historical Example: Until late 90's concerts more or less tracked inflation. After files sharing prices way out paced inflation.  So before 90s concerts where advertisements for CDs.  After file sharing, free music was the advertisement for concerts.

As a manager one should always looks for complements.

### 2.4.5 Strategy 3: Network Effect

Networked Business - As the size of the network grows, it becomes more attractive to sellers or buyers.

Platform Companies are networked business, and they achieve growth from the network affect.

Companies that can exploit networks achieve rapid growths.

Networking Effects are examples of increasing returns and virtuous circuits.  As your size increases the willingness to pay increases.

#### Pricing for Network Effect

+ Network affected Markets are also known as winner take all markets due to the positive feedback inherent in the industry.  
+ To price in these sorts of markets you do the reverse of normal markets and price as possible since the future WTP depends on the number of existing users you want to capture as many users as possible.

### 2.4.6 Creating Network Effects

+ Pokemon created network effect since they designed a game based around trading.
