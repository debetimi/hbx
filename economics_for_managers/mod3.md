# Module 3 - Suppliers and Cost

## 3.1 An Introduction to Cost

### 3.1.1 Books Publishers, Disrupted

With the Kindle, many of the published worried about the cannibalization of profits of traditional books which are more profitable, as well as commoditize publishing in general.  However, ebooks can also lower costs for publishers.

**Willingness to Sell** - The lowest price at which a supplier is willing to sell their inputs. (products, labor)

#### Work Example - Your willingness to sell your labor.

People might work at company like google or facebook because it might help your career later, or because you might learn a lot.

**Value Created** = WTP - WTS

**Value Captured** = Price - Cost

Price are Cost are choices made by company but ultimately they reflect in large part how much value the company creates.

The distinction between value created and value captured is critical disticntion in business and busines strategy.  It is also useful to captured value captured by buyers, WTP - Price and value captured by suppliers which is Cost - WTS.

Buyers and Suppliers have completing claims on the value true.  Buyers and Suppliers are your **competitors** when it comes to capturing value.

### 3.1.2 The profitability from Going Digital.

Ex: Currently Publisher makes $1 dollar profit from selling a print book for $25.  The publisher receives $12.50 (11.50 go to B&M shop).  25% of 12.50 goes to royalties, and and another 25% goes to the cost of running the business leaving a gross marking of $6 dollars.  There is an operating cost of 83% of gross margin so the company nets $1 dollar.

Benefits of E-Books
 + No Returns
 + Printing/Binding
 + Shipping
 + No Storage

Since all the physical costs are gone, even though you've reduced the price of the product the costs have gone done a lot as well.  This means that although the revenue pool declines the profit pool doesn't neccessarily decline as well.

## 3.2 Fixed Versus Variable Costs

## 3.2.1 Transitioning from Print to Digital

Fixed Costs - Costs that are fixed no matter the scale.  This means the price per unit improves as you increase the number of units.

Variable Cost - Costs that scale with the number of units.  This means the price per unit is generally fixed.

It is important to know the structure of the costs, what components are fixed and what components are variable.
 + In the Random House example, the publisher has high fixed caused for publishing, printing, warehousing a great deal of fixed costs.
 + This explains why they might resist the kindle.  As we've seen due to fixed costs, a hybrid approach is actually quite costly for them because the cost per unit of the printed book dramatically increases.
 + So while $10 books might be reasonable for the long term, in the short term they needer higher prices.

High Fixed Costs Business - Suspectible to slight changes in demand.  This is scene in retail, hotel, and airline industry.  Slight changes in capacity can turn significant profit into signficant loss because of fixed cost.

_Interesting_: Physical books are the best marketing for e-books.  So if Penguin was to go completely digital they would sell fewer books.

### 3.2.3 More about Cost

**Opportunity Costs** - The indirect costs that occur that you have to take account of.

**Opportunity Costs** - Measures the value of the best alternative use of a resource.

Ex: You rent a building with an old lease pay well below market.  When you do your account you should consider the opportunity cost of what else you could do with building.  Perhaps you could rent it out at the current market rate and pocket that money.


### 3.2.4 Opportunity Costs and Decision Making

**Opportunity Cost** = Value of Foregone Opportunities.
