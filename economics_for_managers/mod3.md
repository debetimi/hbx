# Module 3 - Suppliers and Cost

## 3.1 An Introduction to Cost

### 3.1.1 Books Publishers, Disrupted

With the Kindle, many of the published worried about the cannibalization of profits of traditional books which are more profitable, as well as commoditize publishing in general.  However, ebooks can also lower costs for publishers.

**Willingness to Sell** - The lowest price at which a supplier is willing to sell their inputs. (products, labor)

#### Work Example - Your willingness to sell your labor.

People might work at company like google or facebook because it might help your career later, or because you might learn a lot.

**Value Created** = WTP - WTS

**Value Captured** = Price - Cost

Price are Cost are choices made by company but ultimately they reflect in large part how much value the company creates.

The distinction between value created and value captured is critical disticntion in business and busines strategy.  It is also useful to captured value captured by buyers, WTP - Price and value captured by suppliers which is Cost - WTS.

Buyers and Suppliers have completing claims on the value true.  Buyers and Suppliers are your **competitors** when it comes to capturing value.

### 3.1.2 The profitability from Going Digital.

Ex: Currently Publisher makes $1 dollar profit from selling a print book for $25.  The publisher receives $12.50 (11.50 go to B&M shop).  25% of 12.50 goes to royalties, and and another 25% goes to the cost of running the business leaving a gross marking of $6 dollars.  There is an operating cost of 83% of gross margin so the company nets $1 dollar.

Benefits of E-Books
 + No Returns
 + Printing/Binding
 + Shipping
 + No Storage

Since all the physical costs are gone, even though you've reduced the price of the product the costs have gone done a lot as well.  This means that although the revenue pool declines the profit pool doesn't neccessarily decline as well.

## 3.2 Fixed Versus Variable Costs

## 3.2.1 Transitioning from Print to Digital

Fixed Costs - Costs that are fixed no matter the scale.  This means the price per unit improves as you increase the number of units.

Variable Cost - Costs that scale with the number of units.  This means the price per unit is generally fixed.

It is important to know the structure of the costs, what components are fixed and what components are variable.
 + In the Random House example, the publisher has high fixed caused for publishing, printing, warehousing a great deal of fixed costs.
 + This explains why they might resist the kindle.  As we've seen due to fixed costs, a hybrid approach is actually quite costly for them because the cost per unit of the printed book dramatically increases.
 + So while $10 books might be reasonable for the long term, in the short term they needer higher prices.

High Fixed Costs Business - Suspectible to slight changes in demand.  This is scene in retail, hotel, and airline industry.  Slight changes in capacity can turn significant profit into signficant loss because of fixed cost.

_Interesting_: Physical books are the best marketing for e-books.  So if Penguin was to go completely digital they would sell fewer books.

### 3.2.3 More about Cost

**Opportunity Costs** - The indirect costs that occur that you have to take account of.

**Opportunity Costs** - Measures the value of the best alternative use of a resource.

Ex: You rent a building with an old lease pay well below market.  When you do your account you should consider the opportunity cost of what else you could do with building.  Perhaps you could rent it out at the current market rate and pocket that money.


### 3.2.4 Opportunity Costs and Decision Making

**Opportunity Cost** = Value of Foregone Opportunities.

Aquisitions are often driving by a desire to control costs by buying upstream provider.

Accounting Costs and Opportunity Costs are complementary not competitive they serve differnt purposes.

Accounting Cost - Useful for investors

Economic Costs - Including opportunity costs are what you want to look at when deciding where to allocate resources.

## 3.3 Relative Cost Analysis

### 3.3.1 Introduction to Relative Cost

### 3.3.2 Relative Cost Analysis

**Relative Cost Analysis** - A comparison of what ones cost for something is compared to their competitiors.

Costs are actually hard to figure out.
 + Sometimes companies use RCA to figure out how to reduce their costs.

Relative costs are best done on a per unit basis.

Example: Comparing Fedex to UPS
 + Fedex average product is a box
 + Average UPS product is a letter
 + To compare Fedex and UPS you want to focus on where they compete which is on the overnight letter.

 How to perform RCA: Bottom Up
  + Start with your costs broken down bit by bit
  + Understand what drives your cost
   + Understand how you differ from competition on each driver
  + Go cost item by cost item and compare to competitor

 Top Down:
  + Look at the financial statements and see it the top level matches with your cost down analysis.


You always what to separate the fixed costs and variable cost in per unit cost analysis. This distinction is very similar to marginal cost and average cost.

### 3.3.3 A price war

Make sure to distinguish fixed cost and variable cost in cost per unit.

The ability to capture value comes from being *different* and being able to capture values. Otherwise you can get into a price war which only captures value for customers.

Competitive Advantage - Comes from being different. The only way to capture more value is to create more of it than other companies do.

Let’s summarize relative cost analysis in closing. There are three steps to a relative cost analysis. 

### 3.3.4 Applications of Relative Cost Analysis

+ First, understanding your costs. 
+ Second, estimating your competitor’s cost—which can require a fair amount of creative or “detective work,” as Professor Rivkin describes.
+ Third, using the relative cost estimates to explore how decisions are affected. These could be decisions about whether or not to enter a business (are your costs low enough), about whether you can compete in a price war, about where your advantage really comes from, and so on.

## 3.4 Supply Curves

### 3.4.1 The Alumninum Industry

In this portion we extend the analysis to to think about costs of an entire industry.

### 3.4.2 The Cost Structure of Aluminum

When looking at whether or not to continue or shut down, ONLY look at the variable costs.  Remember the fix costs are fixed, they are sunk, even though you can reduce the cost per unit, you can never remove the cost.  Therefore if price is greater than variable cost you should always produce

### 3.4.3 The Supply Curve for Aluminum

**Supply Curve** - At any given price, how much aluminum would be supplied by all firms in the industry.

As demand for aluminum increases, plants with increased variable cost begin to operate.  As demand increase you begin to rely on less efficient costs.

**NOTE**: Supply curve only relies on variable costs.

### 3.4.4 Investing in an Alumnium Plant

Should you enter a market - Incumbent?
 + Compare your variable costs to the variable cost of least efficient producer.

Should you enter a market - New Entrant?
 + Compare your average costs to the variable costs of the least efficient producer.

Why don't the most efficient plants increase capacity and take over?
 + Variable costs might increase for example increased capacity might increase need for labor and if labor is here then marginal costs increase.

#### Differnt Types of Supply Curves
+ Long Run - Before plants have been build include both fixed and variable costs
+ Short Run - Once in operation consider only variable costs.

### 3.4.5 The Supply of Power

If you can cover your variable costs you should be operating.  This might lead to cases where companies are operating at loss (not meeting their average cost). If you think about however, by not operating would be incurring even greater loss.

Since you have to compare your average cost to the marginal cost of incumbents, you have to be significantly better than incumbent when entering a high fixed cost industry.
 + This is why new entrants in high fixed cost industry like airlines or cable industry struggle.  Incumbents are willing to retaliate by dropping prices to marginal prices.

## 3.5 Scale Economies 

### 3.5.1 Fixed Costs and Market Structure

Fixed cost are horrible in declining industries and great in growing industries as you can spread cost across fewer or greater number of units respectively.

Companies or investors trying to figure out how many competitors a company will have in the future need to look at the fixed cost structure of the business.

### 3.5.2 Minimum Efficient Scale

**Break Even** - The minimum number of customers/units to break even on costs i.e. have 0 profit.

**Minuimum Efficient Scale** - In classical economics, the minimum efficient scale is defined as the lowest production point at which long-run total average costs (LRATC) are minimized. 

High Fixed Cost lead to high minimum efficient scale.
 + In other words, to produce efficiently, firms with high fixed costs need to spread those costs across a much higher output than firms with low fixed costs do.
  + These business are colloquially referred to as "volume businesses"


### 3.5.4 The Mirage of Scale
It is important to see where the fixed cost actually live, scaling nationally for example might not always reduce fixed costs.

#### Netflix vs Blockbuster
For Blockbuster the fixed cost were local. This means as Blockbuster scaled the fixed costs were often incurred again, on a per store basis.  So Blockbuster as a company doesn't scale well nationally, rather it scales locally.

Netflix on the other hand had warehouses and mailed DVDs.  This means as they scaled their fixed costs were spread among an increasing number of customers.

#### Summary
Fixed costs are endemic to business, as we’ve seen in this module so far. And, fixed costs create scale economies that benefit them. The larger you are, the more easily you can spread your fixed costs across more customers. As a result, your average costs are lower than rivals who are smaller.

But, there are a few things to also keep in mind about fixed costs and “the mirage of scale”, as Larry Culp terms it. Fixed costs do not imply that larger is better. Size is oftentimes accompanied by bureaucracy or complacency—in turn resulting in negative scale economies. Finally, it’s also important to understand where fixed costs reside. If fixed costs operate largely at the local or regional market level, it doesn’t pay to be national or global. Doing so can have devastating consequences for a firm. Remember Bally's?

### 3.5.5 Google vs Bing

Market leader want high fixed costs so that the customers are un likely to switch to competitors.

Followers want low fixed cost so customers can easily switch to their product.
